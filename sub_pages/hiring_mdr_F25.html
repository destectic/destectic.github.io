        <b>University of Calgary’s School of Architecture, Planning, and Landscape (SAPL) invites applications
          for the Master of Design Research (MDR) program with a focus on Computational Design. </b>
          SAPL has a long-standing tradition of excellence in architecture, urbanism, and landscape
          design research through its renowned Master of Environmental Design (MEDes) program, recognized
          both nationally and internationally. In response to the evolving social and design research landscape,
          SAPL is transitioning the degree from MEDes to the new Master of Design Research (MDR),
          with the aim of cultivating the next generation of research pioneers who will lead the future of design.<br>
          Within the program, computational design research is conducted through DESTECTIC,
          a laboratory that explores the integration of classical and contemporary design technologies with
          artificial intelligence, generative systems, and data science. Students interested in combining
          design with advanced technologies, particularly AI and computational methods, will engage
          in research through DESTECTIC.
        </p>

        <p style='line-height: 1.8'>
          Through a combination of research and coursework, the program offers a wide range of research topics,
          including but not limited to:
